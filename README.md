# data-plotter
This program plots simple data sets in the form of lists of numbers.
Currently, the program uses immediate mode to render the graph, so performance isn't the best.

The origional source code to the project was lost, and the code you see here is decompiled from the jar. 
Some functions and values may appear strange.
